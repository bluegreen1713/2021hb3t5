		<h1>Gigi Morgan Clark - Threshold 5 Narrative Assignment</h1>
		<h2>What is a threshold?</h2>
		<p>A threshold is a significant point in time where there is (was) a sudden increase in complexity. This can range anywhere from the Big Bang to a microthreshold such as the rise of Eukaryotes.</p>
<!--  the story of first life at the bottom of the ocean, near hydrothermal vents, goldilocks conditions -->
		<h2>Where and how did life first emerge?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The most prominent theory for the beginning of life is that the first lifeforms were formed deep in the ocean near hydrothermal vents, where the goldilocks conditions were perfect.
		</ul>
		<h2>What are goldilocks conditions?</h2>
		<p>Goldilocks conditions are <em>just-right</em> conditions for complexity to emerge. Just like how in <em>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</em> she finds her just-right porridge, bed, and chair, complexity needs just-right conditions to emerge, as well.</p>
		<h3>What were the goldilocks conditions for life on Earth to emerge?</h3>
		<p>Well, there are three main goldilocks conditions that need(ed) to be met:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some type of liquid: for life to emerge, the atoms need to be able to link up, or exchange information. They can't do this in a solid, where they are too close together, but they also can't do this in a gas, where they are too far apart.
			<li>Energy: not too little, not too much. If there is too little energy, life will not be able to emerge. But if there is too much, it will spread the atoms apart, so they cant make life!
		</ul>
		<h2>Procaryotes and Photosynthesis</h2>
		<!--rise of the prokaryotes/photosynthesis -->
		<p>Organisms with photosynthesis brought on the rise of the procaryotes, which are multi-celled organisms
		<!-- Darwinian evolution, natural selection, journey of The Beagle -->
		<h2>Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All people are the same species, not <em>fifteen</em> different subspecies, with, of course, White people on top.
				<li>Life forms will adapt slightly to whatever environment they are given, such as different birds having different beak shapes depending on what type of food is in the environment around them.
					<li>One example of this is how humans have adapted to the environment they are given, such as how, say, a person living in Australia will have slightly different genes than someone living in South Africa or someone living in Russia.
		</ul>
